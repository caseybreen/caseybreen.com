**Tuesdays 16:00-18:00pm, Sociology Seminar Room**

[Joint instruction with [Ridhi Kashyap](https://www.sociology.ox.ac.uk/people/ridhi-kashyap#tab-2366051)]

The growing availability of new streams of data, expansion of computational power and the
digitalisation of our lives has created new questions and research opportunities for social
and population scientists. The course will introduce students to a range of methodological 
and substantive topics in computational social science. We will cover topics such as digital
trace and big data, machine learning, non-probability sampling, social networks, and agent-based 
modelling and microsimulation. The course will consist of seminar and lab sessions (taught in R), 
where students will engage with research in computational social science and learn to apply basic
computational methods to research problems based on existing research papers.

### Learning Outcomes:

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Critically evaluate and engage with contemporary scientific debates within the area of computational social science and identify key contributions;

2. Apply computational social science perspectives to formulate and address relevant sociological and demographic questions; 

3. Demonstrate proficiency in some techniques of computational social science, including methods for processing and analysing digital and unstructured data, basic methods for machine learning and addressing bias in non-probability samples;

4. Apply and engage with a computational social science perspective to address their own research problems and areas of interests.

### Teaching arrangement:

The teaching will be organised in a combination of lectures, discussion-based seminars, and three computer labs. All weeks will feature an introductory lecture, followed by either a discussion seminar (weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8) or lab (weeks 2, 4, 6).

In discussion seminar weeks (1, 3, 5, 7 and 8), readings marked with * in the reading list will serve as core readings for that week. We are asking all participants to present one of these core readings in a max 10 minute presentation (no slides required) during the course in the format of a synthesis and peer review. The presenter for the readings for a given week will be made available on Canvas the previous week.

In presenting the paper to the group, please focus on: What is the objective of the paper, what are the main contributions, and what are its limitations? If it is an empirical paper, does the analysis/data seem convincing and does the strength of the argument match the data and evidence? If it is a theoretical/perspective paper, what questions and ideas does it generate for research in computational social science?

All participants – and not only those presenting – are expected to read, at minimum, all core papers for the week. We strongly encourage you to review all readings for a given week.

### Requirements:

The course will be taught in R (using RStudio). Students are expected to have R and RStudio downloaded and be familiar with R. We recommend completing a basic introductory course in R via CodeAcademy or equivalent prior to the course. As an additional resource, we suggest the following text, which is freely available online:

- *Wickham, Hadley, Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel, and Garrett Grolemund. 2023. R for Data Science: Import, Tidy, Transform, Visualize, and Model Data (2nd Edition). O’Reilly.*

### Course Assessment:

The course will be examined by:

1. Essay (max 3000 words) in response to one from a list of questions provided by instructors, provided in week 8, due on Friday, noon, week 0 Trinity term; 

2. Problem set, involving code and markdown report, that applies computational techniques learned during the module, provided in week 8, due on Friday, noon, week 0 Trinity term.

### Reading list 

Note: starred (★) papers are for presentation to the group by the assigned student for that week.
These are the core readings for the week.
