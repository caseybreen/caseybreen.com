### Graduate Courses
<hr>

<b>Topics in Computational Social Science</b>
<a style="white-space: nowrap" href="/teaching/css/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Course Page</button>
</a>

The growing availability of new streams of data, expansion of computational power and the digitalisation of our lives has created
new questions and research opportunities for social and population scientists. The course will introduce students to a range of methodological 
and substantive topics in computational social science. We will cover topics such as digital trace and big data, machine learning, non-probability 
sampling, social networks, and agent-based modelling and microsimulation. The course will consist of seminar and lab sessions (taught in R), where
students will engage with research in computational social science and learn to apply basic computational methods to research problems based on existing research papers.


### Undergraduate Courses
<hr>

<b>Introduction to Social Networks </b>
<a style="white-space: nowrap" href="/teaching/social_networks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-primary">Course Page</button>
</a>

This course introduces the science of social networks—how people are connected and how those connections shape social behavior, 
opportunities, and outcomes. We will use concepts and methods from the social, natural, and mathematical sciences to define networks, 
analyze network data, and examine how networks are applied in both academic research and practice. The course draws on examples from 
public health (e.g., HIV prevention at CDC and UNAIDS), sociology (e.g., how friendship networks influence educational outcomes), 
and technology (e.g., the rise and diffusion of social media platforms in Silicon Valley). We will combine theory, empirical research,
and hands-on data analysis to build a foundational understanding of social networks.

<!-- Abstract -->
<div id="intro_r" class="collapse">
  <br />
This course is designed for incoming graduate students. It focuses on foundational R programming skills, emphasizing reproducible workflows
and best practices for data analysis in the social sciences. Each session is approximately 3 hours and includes lectures, in-class exercises,
and take-home problem sets with solutions.
