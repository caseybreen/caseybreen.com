I am a Senior Postdoctoral Fellow in Computational Social Science at the University of Oxford. I completed my Ph.D. in Demography at UC Berkeley supervised by [Dennis Feehan](https://dennisfeehan.org/) and [Joshua R. Goldstein](https://jrgoldstein.com/). 

My research develops and applies computational and demographic methods to examine questions in population health. In one line of research, I advance understanding of health
and mortality disparities in the United States by combining multiple administrative datasets using record linkage techniques, such as full-count census records and population-level mortality data. A second line of my research develops and applies network-based methods to sample hard-to-reach populations and estimate demographic rates.
