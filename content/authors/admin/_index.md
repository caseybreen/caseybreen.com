# About 

I am a demographer and Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of Texas at Austin, affiliated with the Population Research Center and the Center for Aging and Population Studies. I completed a Ph.D. in Demography and an M.A. in Biostatistics from the University of California, Berkeley, and was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford.

My research develops and applies computational and demographic methods to examine questions in population health and mortality. My work has been published in *Proceedings of the National Academy of Science*, *Demography*, *American Journal of Epidemiology*, and *Population and Development Review*, among other outlets.
